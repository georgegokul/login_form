This project demonstrates a login form with robust client-side validation. The form validates the email format, ensures the password meets complexity criteria, and confirms that the passwords match. It also includes a feature to toggle password visibility.

## Features

- **Email Validation**: Ensures the email input matches a standard email pattern, adding or removing an invalid class based on the match.
- **Password Visibility Toggle**: Allows users to show or hide password input using eye icons, toggling the input type between text and password.
- **Password and Confirmation Validation**: Verifies the password meets complexity requirements and confirms the passwords match, adding an invalid class if validations fail.
